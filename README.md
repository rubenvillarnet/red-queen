# Red Queen
## Description
Red Queen is a classic Tower Defense game. Your goal is to build and upgrade towers, and prevent the enemies to reach the left side of the field.
## How to play
![gameplay](media/screencast.gif)
- **Place new towers** by clicking in the *new tower* button and then in the desired slot.
- **Upgrade existing towers** by selecting them and then clicking in the *upgrade* button.
- Each time you defeat an enemy you'll earn money.
- *Be careful!* As the game progresses, the enemies will be faster and stronger (but they will give you more money).
- If you reach 0 lifes the game will be over!

## Technologies used
The game is entirely created by using the HTML5 Canvas and pure JavaScript (no library or framework is used).

Please keep in mind that the game is far from finished; I intend to add more features in the future, such as:
- More types of towers.
- New kinds of enemies.
- Improved graphics and gameplay.
- And many more! (I hope so).
